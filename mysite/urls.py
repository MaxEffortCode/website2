Class-based views
    1. Add an import:  from other_app.views import Home
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', Home.as_view(), name='home')

    1. Import the include() function: from django.urls import include, path

"""
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include("main.urls")), #'' is for homepage to direct to include("main.urls") located in mysite/main/urls.py
    #all other links proceding '' will lead to urls.py for a matching name. ie website/home would go to urls.py and look for a path that 
    #has path("home/", views.HomehtmlPageCode, name="function in views.py")
