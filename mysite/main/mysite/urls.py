"""mysite URL Configuration

The `urlpatterns` list routes URLs to views. For more information please see:
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/http/urls/
Examples:
Function views
    1. Add an import:  from my_app import views
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', views.home, name='home')
Class-based views
    1. Add an import:  from other_app.views import Home
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', Home.as_view(), name='home')
Including another URLconf
    1. Import the include() function: from django.urls import include, path
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('blog/', include('blog.urls'))
"""
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include
from register import views as v


urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include("main.urls")), #'' is for homepage to direct to include("main.urls") located in mysite/main/urls.py
    #all other links proceding '' will lead to urls.py for a matching name. ie website/home would go to urls.py and look for a path that 
    #has path("home/", views.HomehtmlPageCode, name="function in views.py")
    path("register/", v.register, name="register"),
    path('<int:id>', include("main.urls")),
    path('', include("django.contrib.auth.urls")),
